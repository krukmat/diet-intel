## Brief overview
This project involves individual tasks with meticulously documented progress that should be tracked immediately upon completion. The user requests detailed documentation in specific markdown files, requiring comprehensive technical details such as token usage, file paths, and implementation details. This is a project-specific rule focused on just-in-time documentation updates rather than deferred reporting.

## Documentation requirements
- Always update specified documentation files immediately after completing each task
- Include precise token counts for each completed task using exact measurements
- Mark tasks as completed with checkmarks (✅) in the documentation
- Record file paths, byte sizes, and technical implementation details
- Document any execution issues, errors, or pending adjustments immediately
- Update global progress counters and completion percentages after each task
- Maintain chronological order and timestamp documentation updates

## Task completion workflow
- Complete the technical implementation first
- Measure and record token usage immediately
- Update documentation with implementation details and token counts
- Mark the task as completed (✅) in the document
- Verify documentation accuracy before proceeding
- Only proceed to next task after documentation is updated

## Technical verification
- Always use `wc -c` to accurately count bytes/tokens after file modifications
- Document test execution results, including any failures or pending fixes
- Record performance metrics, file sizes, and implementation quality indicators
- Capture error messages, stack traces, and incident responses in documentation

## Communication style
- Use concise, direct communication during technical implementation
- Switch to detailed explanations when documenting progress or explaining technical decisions
- Immediately document any task completion status changes
- Provide token counts and progress percentages as verification of progress

## Quality assurance
- Treat documentation updates as part of task completion requirements
- Verify token counts match actual file sizes
- Ensure progress percentages and counters are mathematically accurate
- Cross-reference implementation details with documentation accuracy
