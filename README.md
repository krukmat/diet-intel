### Data Flow Patterns

#### **Authentication Flow**
```
1. User Registration/Login → POST /auth/register or /auth/login
2. FastAPI validates credentials and generates JWT tokens
3. Access token (15min) + Refresh token (30 days) returned
4. Client stores tokens securely
5. Protected API requests include Bearer token
6. Token refresh via /auth/refresh when access token expires
```

#### **Product Barcode Lookup Flow**
```
1. Client scans barcode → POST /product/by-barcode
2. FastAPI validates barcode format (13 digits)
3. Check Redis cache for existing product (< 5ms if cached)
4. If not cached:
   a. Query SQLite products table
   b. If not in DB → call OpenFoodFacts API
   c. Parse and normalize product data
   d. Store in SQLite + Cache in Redis (24h TTL)
5. Return structured product response
```

#### **OCR Nutrition Label Processing Flow**
```
1. Client uploads image → POST /product/scan-label
2. FastAPI receives multipart/form-data (max 10MB)
3. Image preprocessing pipeline (OpenCV):
   a. Grayscale conversion + noise reduction
   b. Adaptive thresholding + upscaling
4. Local OCR processing (Tesseract):
   a. Text extraction with confidence scoring
   b. Multilingual support (English/Spanish/French)
5. If confidence < 70% → offer external OCR fallback
6. Nutrition text parsing with regex patterns
7. Return structured nutrition data + confidence score
```

#### **AI Recipe Generation Flow** *(NEW - September 2025)*
```
1. Client requests recipe → POST /recipe/generate
2. FastAPI validates dietary preferences, cuisine type, time constraints
3. Recipe AI Engine analyzes requirements:
   a. Nutritional profiling and goal alignment
   b. Ingredient selection and optimization
   c. Cooking method analysis for health/taste
4. Generate recipe components:
   a. Intelligent ingredient combinations with quantities
   b. Step-by-step cooking instructions with timing
   c. Complete nutritional analysis per serving
5. Apply optimization algorithms:
   a. Health score calculation and improvement
   b. Macro/micronutrient balancing
   c. Dietary restriction compliance
6. Store generated recipe in SQLite with metadata
7. Cache recipe in Redis (24h TTL) for quick access
8. Return complete recipe with shopping list generation
9. Enable recipe rating/feedback for AI improvement
```

#### **AI Meal Plan Generation Flow**
```
1. Client requests meal plan → POST /plan/generate
2. FastAPI validates user profile and dietary preferences
3. Calculate BMR using Mifflin-St Jeor equation
4. Calculate TDEE with activity level multiplier (1.2-1.9)
5. Query SQLite for suitable products:
   a. Filter by dietary restrictions + allergens
   b. Match nutritional targets
6. Apply greedy selection algorithm:
   a. Breakfast: 25%, Lunch: 35%, Dinner: 30%, Snacks: 10%
   b. Max 3 items per meal (5 with flexibility)
   c. ±5% calorie tolerance (±15% flexible mode)
7. Store meal plan in SQLite with change tracking
8. Cache in Redis (24h TTL) for quick retrieval
9. Return structured meal plan with macro analysis
```

### Performance Characteristics

#### **Caching Strategy (Multi-Tier)**
```
L1 Cache: Application Memory    → Hit Rate: ~95% | Latency: < 1ms
L2 Cache: Redis                → Hit Rate: ~80% | Latency: < 5ms  
L3 Cache: SQLite               → Hit Rate: ~60% | Latency: < 50ms
L4 Storage: External APIs      → Latency: 100-500ms
```

#### **Response Times**
- **Cached Barcode Lookup**: < 5ms
- **Fresh Barcode Lookup**: 100-500ms (OpenFoodFacts API call)
- **Local OCR Processing**: 2-5 seconds
